  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    A creative, detail-oriented professional transitioning into a career in coding. With a strong background in problem-solving, client and project management, and meeting deadlines as a private photo editor, I have developed a keen interest in coding and app development. My experience includes self-teaching HTML and CSS, exploring Python, and conceptualising apps to address health challenges, such as improving time management for individuals with ADHD and supporting people with Alzheimerâ€™s. I am eager to join this coding bootcamp to gain the skills needed to transform these ideas into impactful solutions.
